To get it working, just do a checkout and run 'node server'. Make an account and start chatting!

+Chat app now uses a local instance of MongoDB. At least I got to check out Modulus....

TODO:
<ul>
<li>DONE! ~~Get usernames/email address to show up in chat.~~</li>
<li>Reply feature</li>
<li>DONE! ~~Easier access to profile page~~</li>
<li>Currently borrowing a lame view from a site that helped with figuring out socket. Will make another that uses bootstrap.</li>
<li>Persistent chat (I have a good idea on how to make this work, but it's getting late...)</li>
</ul>
